### Done:
* Implemented in Python the attack on CSS from [A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography](https://toc.cryptobook.us/) (Section 3.8) by [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo) and [Victor Shoup](https://shoup.net/)

### To-do

* Create Attack Game diagram based on the CSS Attack (aprox. 15-30 min)
* Explain why CSS is easy attackable (larger keys, larger bruteforcing time) (aprox. 20 min)
* Create a cipher (maybe based on LFSRs) which is harder to break than CSS (aprox. 4 days)
* Implementation in Python (aprox. 1 hour)
* Find vulnerabilities on the created cipher and implement attack(aprox. 4 days)
* Create Attack Game diagram on the found attack(s) (aprox. 15-30 min)
* Explain why cipher is better than CSS (aprox. 30 min)
* Review, rewrite, review, rewrite, review, rewrite (aprox. 1 week)
